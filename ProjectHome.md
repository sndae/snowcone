## Introduction ##

Since AIR 3.0 Adobe introduced **ActionScript Native Extensions** or **ANE** for short<br>
that allow developers to create AS3 extension libraries based on native code.<br>
<br>
Most ANE focus on one particular functionality: vibration for iOS, gyroscope for Android, etc.<br>
<br>
<b>Snowcone</b> will provide ANE to extend AIR globally at the API level<br>
<br>
for example:<br>
Snowcone 1.0 could add both gyroscope and vibration API for both iOS and Android in one single ANE<br>
<br>
and then later<br>
Snowcone 1.1 could add a battery status, contact API again for both iOS and Android<br>
<br>
the goal is, instead of adding 1,2,3, etc. ANE to extend AIR gradually,<br>
to provide 1 ANE that extend AIR as if it was "by default" part of AIR<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

<pre>
Snowcone is here to augment the power of Adobe AIR on mobile devices and desktops,<br>
giving ActionScript developers access to low-level API and features<br>
which are not available through the standard AIR framework.<br>
