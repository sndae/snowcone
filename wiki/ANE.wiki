Prior to Adobe AIR 3, only Adobe could add core features to the runtime.
Developers requiring new features could only wait.
Now developers can extend the runtime themselves.

{{{
A native extension is a combination of:

  * ActionScript classes.

  * Native code. Native code is defined here as code that executes outside the runtime.
    For example, code that you write in C is native code.
    On some platforms, Java code is supported in extensions.
    For the purpose of this documentation, this is also considered “native” code.

Reasons to write a native extension include the following:

  * A native code implementation provides access to device-specific features.
    These device-specific features are not available in the built-in ActionScript classes,
    and are not possible to implement in application-specific ActionScript classes.
    The native code implementation can provide such functionality because it has access
    to device-specific hardware and software.

  * A native code implementation can sometimes be faster
    than an implementation that uses only ActionScript.

  * A native code implementation allows you to reuse existing code.
